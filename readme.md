# moth-talk

This is a baby project created after being annoyed at missing too many Moth events.

## Goals

- Scrape themoth.org once a day.
- If there are tickets available, send an email to notify me/others that we can buy tickets.
- The notification should contain the date, time, location, and theme of the event.

todo(kfcampbell): add tests

This could be a good example project if all the todos were cleaned up a bit.
