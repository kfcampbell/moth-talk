# moth-talk

This is a baby project created after being annoyed at missing too many Moth events.

## Goals

- Scrape themoth.org once a day.
- If there are tickets available, send a text (using twilio) to notify a list of phone numbers.
- The notification should contain the date, time, location, and theme of the event.
